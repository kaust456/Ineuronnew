       "\"Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions\\n   165\\nCreating Regex Objects \\nAll the regex functions in Python are in the \\nre module. Enter the following \\ninto the interactive shell to import this module:\\n>>> import reNOTE\\n Most of the examples in this chapter will require the \\nre module, so remember to import \\nit at the beginning of any script you write or any time you restart Mu. Otherwise, \\nyou™ll get a \\nNameError: name 're' is not defined error message.\\nPassing a string value representing your regular expression to \\nre.compile() returns a \\nRegex pattern object (or simply, a \\nRegex object).\\nTo create a \\nRegex object that matches the phone number pattern, enter \\nthe following into the interactive shell. (Remember that \\n\\\\d means ﬁa digit \\ncharacterﬂ and \\n\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d-\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d-\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d is the regular expression for a phone \\nnumber pattern.)\\n>>> phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d-\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d-\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d')Now the \\nphoneNumRegex variable contains a \\nRegex object. \\nMatching Regex Objects \\nA Regex object™s \\nsearch() method searches the string it is passed for any \\nmatches to the regex. The \\nsearch() method will return \\nNone if the regex pat\\n-tern is not found in the string. If the pattern \\nis found, the \\nsearch() method \\nreturns a \\nMatch object, which have a \\ngroup() method that will return the \\nactual matched text from the searched string. (I™ll explain groups shortly.) \\nFor example, enter the following into the interactive shell:\\n>>> phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d-\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d-\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d')>>> mo = phoneNumRegex.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')>>> print('Phone number found: ' + mo.group())Phone number found: 415-555-4242The \\nmo variable name is just a generic name to use for \\nMatch objects. \\nThis example might seem complicated at ˜rst, but it is much shorter than \\nthe earlier \\nisPhoneNumber.py\\n program and does the same thing.\\nHere, we pass our desired pattern to \\nre.compile() and store the result\\n-ing \\nRegex object in \\nphoneNumRegex. Then we call \\nsearch() on \\nphoneNumRegex and \\npass \\nsearch() the string we want to match for during the search. The result \\nof the search gets stored in the variable \\nmo. In this example, we know that \\nour pattern will be found in the string, so we know that a \\nMatch object will \\nbe returned. Knowing that \\nmo contains a \\nMatch object and not the null value \\nNone, we can call \\ngroup() on \\nmo to return the match. Writing \\nmo.group() inside \\nour \\nprint() function call displays the whole match, \\n415-555-4242.\""
